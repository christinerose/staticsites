Landis 1.0 by tgpo | http://www.tgpo.org


Simply copy the Landis folder into your themes folder and switch to it in the admin panel.

Under the Presentation Admin Panel you'll see the Landis Settings page.  From there you can add the custom tags to Landis.


Special Thanks to Marc Hodges ( http://sevennine.net/ ) for WP Audioscrobbler plugin, which was used as the baseline for the custom tags functions.
