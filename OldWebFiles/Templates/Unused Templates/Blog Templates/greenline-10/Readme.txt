Greenline is a simple three column theme using a black and green color scheme.
There are two sidebars, one to the left of the content and one to the right.
Both sidebars are fixed width while the content area will adjust depending on the window size.
As a result the theme overall is a fluid width theme.
Both sidebars are widget ready.
It is released under a GPL licence, however I would appreciate it if you leave the footer credits.
