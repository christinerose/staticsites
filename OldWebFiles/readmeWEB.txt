Read Me - BMF Web Information

After bluemoosefilms.com expired without a reminder from WSMDomains, I transferred this web hosting service to thebluemoosepress.com.

Although I still can't effectively manage the domains through AceNet, it is so much cheaper, that I've switched all to AceNet.

Registering thebluemoosepress.com with AceNet as the new business domain. Will transfer bluemoosefilms.com in 45 days when it's up for renewal.

Enterprise Hosting by Acenet, Inc. Paid hosting through March 2011.
Domain name registration/transfer $7.95.

Most domains currently parked at WSM Domains. As they come up for renewal, I will change them all to AceNet. Registered burninglam.com on 2 April for one year as my "free" domain name with the upgrade to Enterprise. If I am able to efficiently manage this domain through AceNet, I will transfer the others.
