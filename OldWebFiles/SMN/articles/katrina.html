<B>The Invasion of Katrina</B><BR>
By Thomas Rowe<BR>
September 10, 2005
<P>
Katrina has invaded the Gulf Coast. Cities have been leveled and homes destroyed. The infrastructure is gone. Businesses and jobs are gone. Hundreds are feared dead. Hundreds of thousands have been displaced and are suffering. Some still have no food or water. It will take years to clean up this mess. This government and this people have responded with the greatest of magnanimity. Hearts, homes and wallets have been opened to the victims of this natural disaster. Compassion and sympathy abound. (Both of these words mean, “to suffer with.”)
<P>
But a question needs to be asked. It is unfathomable that this tender and loving government and people mentioned above have themselves invaded two sovereign nations. They have leveled cities and destroyed homes. Infrastructures are gone. Tens of thousands of innocent persons have been killed. Other tens of thousands have been displaced and are suffering. It will take years to clean up this mess.
<P>
It is irrational that a government and a people who are at once tender, loving and caring to one group of human beings are at the same time causing destruction, suffering and death to another group of human beings.
<P>
Like the Roman god Janus, this nation has a head that shows two faces; one is good, the other is evil.
<P>
Once again, Mother Nature has sun her favorite song to Mankind: namely, “Whatever You Can Do, I Can Do Better.”
