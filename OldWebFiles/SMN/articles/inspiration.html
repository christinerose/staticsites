<B>Cindy Sheehan = Continuing Inspiration</B><BR>
By Christine Rose<BR>
August 21, 2005
<P>
Thank you Cindy Sheehan<BR>
Thank you Robert Shetterly<BR>
Thank you Howard Zinn, Noam Chomsky, Amy Goodman, Michael Moore, Ralph Nader, Medea Benjamin …. The list goes on and on.
<P>
These are people who inspire me. And there are many more.
<P>
I’m a political activist – who hasn’t been very active or political lately.
<P>
I allowed myself to be bogged down by the trials of life – petty, but necessary things like money and finding a home and making a living. I’ve been feeling the strain of putting everything into my films – money and soul – leaving myself with little of both.
<P>
I took a break. I took a break from politics. I took a break from the news. Apart from the headlines on <A HREF="http://www.commondreams.org" TARGET="TOP">Common Dreams</A> (my homepage), I read nothing for at least two months. I was so out of the loop that I didn’t realize the revolution was growing a short 3 hours away in Crawford, Texas because of one grieving mother. I missed a great opportunity to be heard in unison with others: to join in Camp Casey and stand in solidarity for peace. I couldn’t have chosen a worse time to take a break.
<P>
Today I read an article, my first in a long time, on Common Dreams called “Liars & Hypocrites” by Cindy Sheehan. That article led me to another by Robert Shetterly which subsequently led me to his work of portraits “Americans Who Tell The Truth.”
<P>
And that’s all I needed.
<P>
Cindy Sheehan said something in her article that really stuck:
"If you fall on the side that is pro-George and pro-war, you get your ass over to Iraq, and take the place of somebody who wants to come home. And if you fall on the side that is against this war and against George Bush, stand up and speak out."
<P>
Rarely does something so impassioned and simple strike so deeply. How can anybody still be on the fence? If you’re on our side of the fence, the side of the fence for peace, then please stand up and speak out. You never know if something you say, no matter how simple it seems to you, will be the trigger to inspire someone else to action.
<P>
I’ve been inspired by the words of Cindy Sheehan. By the work of Robert Shetterly &  Michael Moore. By the life of Howard Zinn. By the tireless activism of Medea Benjamin. By the persistence of Ralph Nader. 
<P>
Those who saw my first film, <A HREF="http://www.libertybound.com" TARGET="TOP"><I>Liberty Bound</A></I>, and heard me speak on tour last fall were inspired by my work and my words during the Q&A. I’ve received many emails telling me so, although at my most self-deprecating times I often forget it.
<P>
And isn’t that what it’s about? To inspire one another. To recharge each other’s batteries. To take over when one of us needs a break. To never, ever stop until there is peace.
<P>
My break is over. I’m back.
