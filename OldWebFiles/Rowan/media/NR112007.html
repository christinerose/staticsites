<B>AUSTIN, TX—NOVEMBER 20, 2007</B>—Superheroes, Mutants, Villains, and even Turtles roamed the aisles of Wizard World Texas last weekend held in the Arlington Convention Center.  Among known artists such as Ethan Van Sciver and James O’Barr were two newcomers to the fantasy convention scene: Christine & Ethan Rose, authors of the YA fantasy novel Rowan of the Wood.
                <p><P><br />
Christine & Ethan took the fun to heart and dressed in costumes representing two of the major characters in their novel. “The costumes were a big hit,” reports Christine, “I think we were as successful as we were because of the costumes.”  Kids especially enjoyed the costumes and were excited to learn how to write in “secret code” by visiting the fun page of rowanofthewood.com. 
                <p><P><br />
One mother who bought the book for her son returned on Sunday and said, “I just gave it to him this morning, and he’s already halfway through! He said to me: ‘Mom, this is excellent!’”  She told Christine that she was now on her son’s “list,” and he would be anxiously awaiting the sequel.  Similarly, another fan who bought an author-signed copy returned after reading two chapters at the convention to tell Ethan that she loved what she read so far and she couldn’t wait to get home and read the rest.
                <p><P><br />
A limited number of author-signed, preview copies of Rowan of the Wood are available online for $20.00 through the publisher’s website (www.bluemoosepress.com or www.rowanofthewood.com) for a limited time.  The official release is on April 22, 2008.

This is the first novel for authors Christine & Ethan Rose. Christine has produced two documentaries, both available in retail outlets across the country and in Europe, and has published articles in several magazines.  She holds her MA in English with a concentration in Medieval/Renaissance Literature & Folklore. Ethan is the author of over a dozen sci-fi/fantasy short stories. Orphaned at six, he has first-hand knowledge of the foster system and, like the main character Cullen, took refuge in the forest and in his books.
