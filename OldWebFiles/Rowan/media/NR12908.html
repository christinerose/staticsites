<B>AUSTIN, TX—JANUARY 29, 2007</B>—Last week Dalton Publishing, an independent publisher based in Austin, signed with authors Christine & Ethan Rose to publish their premiere novel “Rowan of the Wood.”
<P>
<P><BR />
Although this sets the release date back a few months to August 2008, the authors are excited about working with Dalton and feel that this delay will only make the book better.  Dalton publishes quality literary fiction and specializes in local authors.
<P>
<P><BR />
“We’ve already had such great feedback from those who read the preview edition,” says author Christine Rose, “it can only get better from here with the Dalton team’s expertise behind us.”
<P>
<P><BR />
Now that the authors don’t have to delve into promotion for an April release, they have begun writing the sequel to “Rowan,” the next edition to the planned five-part series.

<FONT SIZE="-2">ABOUT THE AUTHORS
This is the first novel for authors Christine & Ethan Rose. Christine has produced two documentaries, both available in retail outlets across the country and in Europe, and has published articles in several magazines.  She holds her MA in English with a concentration in Medieval/Renaissance Literature & Folklore. Ethan is the author of over a dozen sci-fi/fantasy short stories. Orphaned at six, he has first-hand knowledge of the foster system and, like the main character Cullen, took refuge in the forest and in his books. The happily married couple live in Austin with their canine kids and Shadow, the cat.</FONT>
