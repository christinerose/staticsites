<B>AUSTIN, TX—OCTOBER 16, 2007</B>—With over 500 new books printed every day, it is becoming increasingly difficult to reach one's niche audience.  Even with the internet, most people are suffering from information overload and just shut out new content or unrecognizable names.  There is just too much information to process on top of dealing with bills, work, and family.
                <p><P><br />
More and more people are turning to sites like YouTube to get a daily dose of humor, news, or information in little three to seven minute snippets.  It’s perfect for a coffee break at work, or just when one’s manager is on the neighboring row of cubicles.  A quick escape from Corporate America, YouTube is a breath of fresh air.
                <p><P><br />
Christine Rose, co-author of <I>Rowan of the Wood</I>, is helping to relieve the tedium of corporate boredom by producing a video blog (vlog) entitled Storytime 2.0.  Once a week she covers a chapter in <I>Rowan of the Wood</I> in a very silly, magical way on her vlog.  Throughout the rest of the week she rambles about whatever is on her mind from Columbus Day to costuming.  She has increased her subscription base by ten-fold just in the last two weeks.  Interested parties can view her vlogs and subscribe at <A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/kalitara">www.youtube.com/kalitara</A>
                <p><P><br />
A limited number of author-signed, preview copies of <I>Rowan of the Wood</I> are available online for $20.00 through the publisher’s <A HREF="http://www.bluemoosepress.com/store.html">website</A> for a limited time.  The official release is on April 22, 2008.

<FONT SIZE="-2">ABOUT THE AUTHORS
This is the first novel for authors Christine & Ethan Rose. Christine has produced two documentaries, both available in retail outlets across the country and in Europe, and has published articles in several magazines.  She holds her MA in English with a concentration in Medieval/Renaissance Literature & Folklore. Ethan is the author of over a dozen sci-fi/fantasy short stories. Orphaned at six, he has first-hand knowledge of the foster system and, like the main character Cullen, took refuge in the forest and in his books. The happily married couple live in Austin with their canine kids and Shadow, the cat.</FONT>
