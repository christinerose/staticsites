<B>AUSTIN, TX—SEPTEMBER 12, 2007</B>—Since the final Harry Potter book was released in July, the highways of cyberspace have been in a blogging frenzy by fantasy fans trying to determine who or what to read next. The popular series single-handedly got people of all ages around the world reading again. Now that Harry is thirty-something and married with children, what will fill the imagination of all those new fantasy readers?
                <p><P><br />
Blue Moose Press offers a solution with the publication of their new young adult fantasy novel <B><I>Rowan of the Wood</B></I>.  Filled with denizens of supernatural folk, from wizards to vampires to quite a few Sidhe, it is an intense adventure through magical realms, history, and growing up. The authors, Christine and Ethan Rose, have succeeded in blending a plethora of diverse characters into a cohesive and fascinating tale of tragedy, triumph, and love, liberally sprinkled with magic and mystery. Like Harry Potter, it merges our mundane world with one of magic and adventure, but does so in a very different way, creating worlds much more closely intertwined.  
                <p><P><br />
<B><I>Rowan of the Wood</B></I>, a Celtic-based fantasy for young adults, is the first book of a planned series and will be available in bookstores on Earth Day, April 22, 2008. Its unique look at the Green Man myth and underlying theme of respect for nature makes its Earth Day release appropriate. A Graphic Novel version of the book, with Artwork by Austin artist Ia Layadi, is also in production. The second book of what looks to become a significant series is already under development.  
                <p><P><br />
<FONT SIZE="-2">ABOUT THE AUTHORS
This is the first novel for authors Christine & Ethan Rose. Christine has produced two documentaries, both available in retail outlets across the country and in Europe, and has published articles in several magazines.  She holds her MA in English with a concentration in Medieval/Renaissance Literature & Folklore. Ethan is the author of over a dozen sci-fi/fantasy short stories. Orphaned at six, he has first-hand knowledge of the foster system and, like the main character Cullen, took refuge in the forest and in his books. The happily married couple live in Austin with their canine kids and Shadow, the cat.</FONT>
