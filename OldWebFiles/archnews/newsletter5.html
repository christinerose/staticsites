            <p><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><font color="#000000">Fantasy literature is a pathway to temporary escape…an art that has served me well since I was an adolescent, when I received my first fantasy-themed novel from my aunt.  Madeleine L'Engle’s, “A Wrinkle in Time” was the first of many epic stories I would experience throughout my life.  I was in such awe of this story that I went on to the read the other books that took me back to Meg and Charles Wallace Murray’s world of “tesseract travel” to other dimensions.  I recently learned that Madeleine passed away on September 6th.  I will forever be grateful for her creatively intricate imagination and story-telling abilities.  This novel opened a door that leads to a great library of adventures that have allowed me to, at times, remove myself from the hectic world spinning around me.  The spark to write about my experience with fantasy literature came to me when I found out about another fantasy author’s death.  Robert Jordan, author of the epic series “The Wheel of Time”, passed away on September 16th. </font></span></p>
            <p><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><font color="#000000">I didn’t come fully to the world of fantasy literature until my junior year of high school, when I came down with mononucleosis and was sent to bed for an entire weekend.  A friend at the time insisted that I begin reading the “Dragon Prince” series by Melanie Rawn.  I figured, sure, what else was I going to do while I was feeling this crummy?  A few pages into the novel I was lost in a desert world with two suns, traveling to a palace for an arranged marriage with the new king.  As the story continued, I was introduced to the wild dragons of the desert and a huge cast of characters, some of whom seemed so real I felt as if I had known them all my life.  I went on the read the remaining five books of the series, and after finishing the last I was ready for more.  </font></span></p>

            <p class="text1"><font color="#000000">	The earthquake strikes at 8:46.
            <p class="text1"><font color="#000000">	I know this because I’m staring at the clock on my computer, yawning away the night’s sleep.
            <p class="text1"><font color="#000000">	At the desk beside me, Michael swears, just loud enough to let us know to keep our distance. He’s been on edge ever since his wife left him last month. Not enough time for his family, she said.  He bought a new tie to soothe himself over. It’s now brown from the spilled cappuccino. 
            <p class="text1"><font color="#000000">	People are chattering, going against company policy and swearing out loud. I’m one of them. My carefully-placed clutter is strewn about the floor. How am I supposed to work in this?
            <p class="text1"><font color="#000000">	Maybe I’m not. 
            <p class="text1"><font color="#000000">	Shouts of alarm fill the office. Far off, across the four foot high partitions splitting the warehouse sized room into cozy cubicles, I see it. Black sooty ash obscures the view of the river. The city is on fire.
            <p class="text1"><font color="#000000">	“Think a gas station went up?” Tariq wonders aloud. His parents run a service station somewhere down I-95. For the smoke to be this dense this high, it would have to be something major. If we could see out the window, we’d know how bad the damage was. At the very least, it’ll cost the city millions. 
            <p class="text1"><font color="#000000">	“The building is secure, please remain at work,” a service announcement tells us. Its false bravado echoes off the padded partitions and drop to the carpeted floor along with the soot that sneaks its way into the office. When Rome burned, Nero played his fiddle. If an emperor couldn’t get back to work, how on Earth can we? 
            <p class="text1"><font color="#000000">	The second earthquake hits at 9:02.
            <p class="text1"><font color="#000000">	This one is far smaller than the first, but the building tosses us around, nonetheless. If it’s this bad up here, I hate to think how it is down at street of level. Oliver crosses himself. He picks up his phone and dials out. “Santa Maria,” he says, staring at the receiver. “No dial tone,” he tells me. “My family.”
            <p class="text1"><font color="#000000">	Oliver is fearless in the face of bank executives, one of the greatest salesmen I know, but he is also a tender father. He’s trembling. I give him my Blackberry so he can call home. He thanks me and jogs toward the bathroom for privacy.
            <p class="text1"><font color="#000000">	A runner from a company across the building darts into the office. Every day I ride up the elevator with her. Her hair is always perfect. Today, it is no less perfect, though it clings to her forehead from sweat. I overhear several of her hyperventilated words to our receptionist. “Explosion… smoke in the building… stairwells filled.”
            <p class="text1"><font color="#000000">	Mary Katherine’s eyes fill her bifocals. She dashes to our boss’s office.
            <p class="text1"><font color="#000000">	“What’s going on?” Lydia screams to nobody and everybody at once. Her mascara leaves a sooty trail as it rides her tears down her cheeks. 
            <p class="text1"><font color="#000000">	“Phone call, Braydon,” Oliver says, handing my Blackberry back to me. His face is ashen to the point of livid. Must be bad.
            <p class="text1"><font color="#000000">	“Don’t go to work!” my kid brother screams as I answer my mobile. He’s at college in upstate New York. I ask him if he got the earthquakes there.
            <p class="text1"><font color="#000000">	“They weren’t earthquakes,” Harrison tells me, awe in his voice...

        <p><font color="#000000"><strong><font size="3"><a name="Story #2"></a>Visiting Virginia</font></strong><br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by Dan Friedman</font></p>

             <p class="text1"><font color="#000000">	Andy turned his car to the right into the main gate off of Santa Monica Boulevard and slowly made his way around the traffic circle where he parked behind a row of cars.  We had just eaten at Mel’s Diner, a 50’s retro establishment across the street from Hollywood High School and we had to navigate our way through a collection of narrow back roads to avoid the major anti-war demonstration that had sprung up on Hollywood Boulevard.  While Andy bemoaned the fact that he couldn’t make the turn he wanted and diametrically complained that he wished he had known about the protest so he could take part, I readied my camera in case we passed any landmarks.  This was my first time in Hollywood and I wanted to be prepared.
 <p class="text1"><font color="#000000">	I had rented a car and driven up the I-5 from Long Beach to his house in Burbank, experiencing Los Angeles traffic along the way.  I was still fighting my off-kilter internal clock.  That, combined with my general discomfort whenever I am in strange surroundings had me in a nervous mood and so I missed seeing Disneyland as I drove past it.  All in all it was a fairly simple ride.  Still, I was uncomfortable with the thought of driving myself in unfamiliar territory and Andy had graciously agreed to be my chauffeur for the day.
 <p class="text1"><font color="#000000">		Andy was a friend but not a particularly close one.  He and my old college roommate were friends from childhood and I had known him as a result of that relationship.  He also happened to be one of the few people I knew who lived in L.A. and the only one with whom I would be willing to spend an afternoon (which is a different story).
 <p class="text1"><font color="#000000">	He had moved west from Connecticut more than five years ago to work for Warner Brothers in their television licensing department but he held dreams, like so many who make the same transition between the coasts, of being a screenwriter.  He had won a couple of competitions here and there and I admired his work.  It wasn’t necessarily my taste – he liked to write westerns with elements of sword and sorcery-type fantasy - but I couldn’t argue with his originality and dedication to his craft.  However, it was a bit telling and not all that surprising that after more than five years he was still toiling away at the studio in a desk job.  On the one hand I had tremendous respect for his commitment.  On the other, I questioned when he would decide he had had enough and return to his friends and family in New England.
 <p class="text1"><font color="#000000">		“I wonder the same thing myself,” he answered.  “There are days when I ask myself just how much longer I can last out here like this.  I’m alone, I’m frustrated, but it always comes down to the same thing.  The weather...”

Tossed human in a bin<BR>
down some littered creek<BR>
no one cared until<BR>
it was buried in the news
<P>
Bodies bound and burned<BR>
just behind the church<BR>
flames at night<BR>
and no one seemed to care
<P>
But if the streets are clean and lit<BR>
and the clothing is pricey and labelled right<BR>
then why bother with another dead human being
<P>
Plastic as they come<BR>
plastic they will go<BR>
plastic is the future of tomorrow
<P>
So tie them up at will<BR>
have your daily fill<BR>
of hidden news<BR>
underneath <BR>
the bridge
