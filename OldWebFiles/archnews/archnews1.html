<B>Amazon's Kindle 'out of stock'</B>
<BR>21.11.07 Philip Jones @ TheBookseller.com
<p><p><BR />
<IMG SRC="http://www.thebookseller.com/images/uploaded/1177.jpg" ALIGN="LEFT">Amazon's new e-book device, Kindle, has gone 'out of stock' due to "heavy customer demand". The strong demand for the device comes despite a mixed critical reception, with users on Amazon.com's own website only giving it 2.5 stars out of five.
<p><p><BR />
Nevertheless, Amazon says that it is not now able to ship the device until 29th November. A message on Amazon.com reads: "Due to heavy customer demand, Kindle is temporarily sold out. Because we ship Kindles on a first-come, first-served basis, please ORDER NOW to reserve your place in line."
<p><p><BR />
The latest reviews of the unit continue to be divided. A piece in The Times concludes: "My overwhelming sense after playing with the Kindle is that it is too little, too late to keep up with the surging technology on display in such products as the iPhone."
<p><p><BR />
A review on Forbes, calls its the "anti-iPhone". "It does one thing very well: downloading and displaying text. Unlike Steve Jobs' wondertoy, it's not likely to become a status symbol for hip digerati." However, the piece concludes: "Even so, Amazon's reader is still exciting. The reading experience it creates is just as pleasant and immersive as a book. And more important, it isn't a book; it's a library. The Kindle may be among the first devices that start to shift the way people accumulate literature, transforming shelves of books into a single device that can ride around in a briefcase." It suggests that it could appeal to "law students".
<p><p><BR />
The Economist calls it "the most serious attempt yet to take bookselling into the digital age".
<p><p><BR />
On Amazon.com, 152 users out of the 432 who have so far reviewed the device gave it just one star. Just 85 gave it five stars.

<B>October 22, 2007 - Indie Houses Try Social Networking</B><P> 
<I>MySpace, Facebook build buzz, but maybe not sales</I><P>
by Claire Kirch -- <I>Publishers Weekly</I>, 10/22/2007</I><P><BR />
Larger publishers and authors have been doing it for some time, and now independent presses are experimenting with ways to use social networking sites, promoting their books and authors on Facebook and MySpace, as well as on sites more specifically geared toward bibliophiles, like Shelfari and LibraryThing.
<P><br />
“We cannot promote an author or a book effectively without using new technologies,” said Gary Baddeley, president and publisher of Disinformation Company. “It gives a little house like us the tools to match much of what a large publisher with a marketing team can do.” Baddeley acknowledged, however, that it's difficult to gauge whether promoting books on social networking sites leads to higher sales.
<P><br />
Nevertheless, Disinformation, which began as a Web site, aggressively promotes its authors and their books on social networking sites, particularly MySpace. In fact, the primary responsibility of one of Disinformation's seven employees is Internet marketing, which includes creating and maintaining Disinformation's presence on social networking sites. That employee is responsible for regularly adding new friends to Disinformation's MySpace page, which has, to date, 90,000 friends.
<P><br />
Besides maintaining its own company page, Disinformation creates separate pages for authors who don't want to do it themselves, linking their individual pages to Disinformation's page. Both Disinformation's page and the individual authors' pages are regularly updated with book news, including author tour information.
<P><br />
Unbridled Books, headquartered in Denver and in Columbia, Mo., also aggressively promotes authors and books on MySpace, and the press recently started promoting books on Shelfari as well. Unbridled's Webmaster is responsible for maintaining the publisher's Web site, and she creates and maintains pages for the company and for some of its authors. “She actively seeks out friends through MySpace,” said Caitlin Hamilton Summie, Unbridled's marketing manager. Unbridled currently has more than 400 friends.
<P><br />
Andrea Portes, an Unbridled author, created her own MySpace page and also a separate page, complete with soundtrack, for her novel, Hick; which has 339 friends to date, while its author has 1,130. Summie described Hick as a novel that appeals to a crossover readership. “A lot of YA readers are on MySpace, but they're not going to pick up the San Diego News Tribune and read the review there,” Summie noted.
<P><br />
Last month, Graywolf, the St. Paul–based literary nonprofit press, used Facebook to launch a virtual book tour for The Water Cure, a novel by Percy Everett. The press invited its 427 friends to the virtual book launch, which lasted for two weeks. Of those 427 friends, 159 responded to Graywolf's invitation, with 27 “attending” the online event. The rest—268 friends—had not responded when Facebook took down the page earlier this month, a move that publicist Mary Matze said had to do with Graywolf unintentionally violating Facebook's terms of service. The site sent Graywolf an e-mail telling the press that profiles are for “a single individual only,” and that effective immediately, it would no longer be able to use the account. As an alternative, Facebook said Graywolf could use the company's Group feature, which “allow[s] people to come together to express objectives, discuss issues, post photos, etc.”
<P><br />
Despite having the page closed and receiving only “one or two” orders from Facebook users who bought a copy of The Water Cure by clicking on a link that took them to Graywolf's Web site, Matze insisted that the virtual book launch was well worth it. “So little time and energy was put into it, yet it definitely raised awareness of the title,” she said. “It was one more step in building buzz.”
<P><br />
While the half-dozen small publishers PW spoke to described social networking sites as a valuable, and affordable, marketing tool, Fauzia Burke, the president of FSB Associates, a publicity firm that specializes in Internet marketing and publicity services for publishers and authors, offered a note of caution. “The social sites are a nightmare for publicists,” said Burke, who does not promote her clients on these sites. “It's time-consuming to control who becomes your friends, what messages they post. What works best is getting your book and message out on as many Web sites as possible. That's the most effective form of Web marketing,” Burke insisted. “We have tangible results that blog postings and Web site features sell books. The jury is still out on the effectiveness of social networks.”

<i>Adobe captures ebook standard. What now?</i>
<BR /><I>E Pluribus E-Books Unum E-Reader?</I>
<BR />By David Moynihan 
<BR />Published Saturday 15th September 2007 08:02 GMT - The Register UK
<P><BR />Among the charming aspects of the fledgling electronic book industry is the way very large corporations can skirt ethical boundaries in the field - yet not make much money.
<P><BR />
Adobe Systems, the company whose EULA prohibited reading Alice in Wonderland aloud, and an outfit that once arrested a Russian programmer for pointing out that the DRM on Acrobat wasn't very good, now has a standard for ebook behavior all its own.
<P><BR />
Rejecting the post-modernist assertion that really it's all text, some six months ago, the New York-located International Digital Publishing Forum, and its one employee, Nick Bogarty, announced that agreement had been reached on a new electronic books standard.
<P><BR />
This format, .epub, was to be the XML-based, multi-device, reflowable, universal format two underemployed men in their 50s had demanded. Also, .epub would support PDF. Because everyone knows how great PDF looks on a PalmPilot or cell phone. It may be worth mentioning, there is one gold sponsor of the IDPF, Adobe, and the IDPF's sole employee, has announced he's leaving the position. To go work at Adobe.
<P><BR />
Adobe says its Digital Editions and InDesign will read and create .epub. Digital Editions is kinda like Macromedia's FlashPaper, save where FlashPaper let anybody make any document web-viewable in seconds, Digital Editions only supports books in .epub (and PDF).
<P><BR />
<i>Formatting issues</i>
<BR />Needless to say, apart from a handful of front-runners, nobody greeted the launch of Digital Editions with much enthusiasm. Even the IDPF failed to add a working guide to creating the format on its site.
<P><BR />
There are some flawed .epub examples from IDPF members that wouldn't load or validate.
<P><BR />
Then there were some weird Adobe creations - .epub samples generated by InDesign which add additional files not required in the IDPF spec (as well as the optional PDF for your cellphone). These work, but don't even meet Adobe's own spec.
<P><BR />
The backstory to all this is that Amazon owns a firm by the name of Mobipocket. Mobi is already the largest ebooks retailer, despite not integrating with Amazon's site. Mobi also figured out years ago the wisdom of not charging for software that creates ebooks in its format, and converting anything from Word Documents to simple HTML to PDF (Mobi will support .epub as an input...eventually).
<P><BR />
Then Mobi really got smart and became the only large ebook retailer to give away Project Gutenberg texts, rather than make a few bucks at the expense of customer retention.
<P><BR />
Mobi ain't perfect. There was a poorly-handled outage recently, and the company's location in France apparently means no Mac support until skilled programmers can sneak out when the bodies are next dumped at Chateau d'If.
<P><BR />
<i>Book 'em, Adobe</i>
<BR />However, in October Amazon's got an electronic ink-based reader coming. There is, in other words, almost no reason to pay attention to Adobe's .epub format. Except maybe for Sony's Reader, which is expected to support .epub files some day.
<P><BR />
But clearly the point of this "standard" is to, in the next congressional buying cycle, go for regulatory capture in the form of a "Digital Archive Integrity Act" which will require schools and libraries to buy only "standard works" - no doubt from "standard vendors" such as Adobe, and create barriers to entry for pesky new competitors, like the upstart ebook Romance publishers, which are currently giving Harlequin fits. It's the kind of thing you'd fear, given the implications for censorship when control of content ends up in very few hands,
<P><BR />
I guess we don't have to be too worried, as long as Adobe can't even code to its own bought-and-paid-for spec. ®

<B>August 17, 2007 - iPhones Get Ebooks.</B><P> <a href="http://www.vnunet.com/vnunet/news/2196729/publisher-tunes-ebook-program"><img width="250" vspace="4" hspace="4" height="150" border="1" alt="iphone gets ebooks" src="http://www.blogsmithmedia.com/www.downloadsquad.com/media/2007/08/browseinside.jpg" /></a>
<P>As printed pieces slowly seem to be getting phased out of our lives, eBooks are shifting to the digital lifestyle many of us crave.<br /><br />So the screens are smaller, and the cravings of the printed page aren't there, but HarperCollins believes that devices like the iPhone are where the future of where books lie. The publisher has announced that they have launched a special eBook service that will work with Apple's new iPhone. The service is called <a href="http://mobile.harpercollins.com/browser.asp">Browse Inside</a>, and will allow users to <a href="http://iphone.libredigital.com">take a peek</a> at the first 10 pages of upcoming publications. If users like what they see, they can then pre order the title from their device.<br /><br />The Browse Inside platform will also work with other devices that are Flash enabled, but given the all the iPhone hype they have to pump up the whole iPhone compatibility thing.
