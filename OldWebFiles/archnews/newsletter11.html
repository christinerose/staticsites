<p><span class="text1"><font color="#000000">2008 started off with a bang! We have some great news regarding <I>Rowan of the Wood</I>.  Austin-based Independent Publisher <A HREF="http://www.daltonpublishing.com/">Dalton Publishing</A> has decided to pick up <I>Rowan of the Wood</I> for publication later this year. This is great news, and we at Blue Moose Press are happy to step aside and let this amazing publisher take <I>Rowan</I> straight to the best seller lists! Due to the change in plans, <I>Rowan of the Wood's</I> release date has been pushed to August 2008. Dalton prides themselves on publishing quality, literary fiction; and they believe <I>Rowan</I> will fit in nicely with their library. Two of their authors have been on best seller lists just over the past six months, and we look forward to reporting the same for our friends: authors Christine & Ethan Rose.
</font></span></p>
<p><span class="text1"><font color="#000000">
Christine has begun writing the sequel and has made some editing changes to <I>Rowan of the Wood</I> as well in preparation for the Dalton release this August. We're down to our last box of preview copies. These remaining few will be available only at the ConDFW convention February 22-24 in Dallas, TX. After that, copies of the book will be unavailable until the Dalton release in August.

Once again this holiday, I have had requests for my rum Christmas cake so here goes:  
<p class="text1"><font color="#000000">
<TABLE>
<TR><TD>1 cup sugar    </TD><TD>  1 tsp. baking powder   </TD><TD>1 cup water </TD></TR>
<TR><TD>1 tsp. salt </TD><TD>  1 cup brown sugar</TD><TD> Lemon juice </TD></TR>
<TR><TD>4 large eggs</TD><TD> Nuts </TD><TD>  1 bottle rum </TD></TR>
<TR><TD>2 cups dried fruit</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<p class="text1"><font color="#000000">
Sample the rum to check quality Take a large bowl, check the rum again to be sure it is of the highest quality. 
Repeat.  Turn on the electric mixer. Beat one cup of butter in a large fluffy bowl. Add 1 teaspoon of sugar. Beat again. 
At this point, it is best to make sure the rum is sstill OK. Try another cup just in case.  Turn off the mixerer thingy. 
Break 2 legs and add to the bowl and chuck iin the cup of dried fruit.  Pick the fruit up off the floor.  Mix on the turner. 
If the fried druit getas stuck in the beaterers, just pry it loose with a drewscriver.  Sample the rum to test for tonsisticity. 
Next, sift 2 cups of salt, or something.  Check the rum.  Now sift the lemon juice and strain the nuts.  Add one table. 
Add a spoon of sugar, or somefink. Whatever you can find.  Greash the oven.  Turn the cake tin 360 degrees and try not to fall over.
<p class="text1"><font color="#000000">
Don't forget to beat off the turner.  Finally, throw the bowl through the window.  Finish the rum and wipe the counter with the cat.
<p class="text1"><font color="#000000">
Now have yourself a little Cherry Christmas!

            <p class="text1"><font color="#000000">Robert Beck was tired of being intimidated and humiliated by Mr. Walsh, his boss, so one Friday Robert shot him.<p class="text1"><font color="#000000">
It was really quite easy.<p class="text1"><font color="#000000">
Robert had decided on this drastic course of action after a particularly unpleasant Tuesday. Everything he did that day was wrong in Mr. Walsh's eyes: His figures on the Coty account were wrong; his check of the Benson work was late; his handwriting on the Waters case was illegible. <p class="text1"><font color="#000000">
This tirade would almost have been tolerable if Tuesday hadn't been the tenth anniversary of Robert's joining the firm. Did he get a congratulations? Did he get a thank you for ten years of loyal service? Did he even get a hello? No. All he got was insulted and degraded. <p class="text1"><font color="#000000">
That's when the timid Robert Beck decided to fight back. That's when he decided to kill his boss.<p class="text1"><font color="#000000">
The plan came to Robert easily. Almost too easily...

 <p class="text1"><font color="#000000">The kitchen was dark and damp. No one had lived here for years. The other rooms were the same and in many of them mould grew along the walls like a thick carpet. Instead of furniture, fungus grew from the floorboards and some of them glowed faintly, providing just enough light to see things that were better off left in the dark.
 <p class="text1"><font color="#000000">
In the corner of the Dining Room a peanut sat, quietly rotting away. A kid that had climbed in through the broken window and had never climbed out again had left her there.
 <p class="text1"><font color="#000000">
She wasn’t sure what had happened to him, except that he had dropped her when he was exploring. A little while after that his screams had echoed up from the cellar, making the peanut very nervous. ‘Don’t worry,’ she thought ‘What ever it is won’t be interested in a tiny rotting peanut.’ Although this sounded very brave in her mind, it didn’t make her feel any better and she found herself straining to see in the eerie glow of the fungus, hearing soft footsteps coming closer to her corner. Finally, she thought to herself, ‘Stop it! It’s just your imagination. There is nothing in here except mould and fungus!’ This did make her feel slightly better, so she took a deep breathe and settled down to do some serious rotting, hoping that if there was anything in the house, she would be gone before it found her. 
She was dozing slightly when she heard the first whisper. It was so soft that at first she thought she had dreamed it.
 <p class="text1"><font color="#000000">
“Little Peanut,” The whisper said “Little Peanut! Where are you?”
 <p class="text1"><font color="#000000">
The peanut shivered and ignored it, hoping in her heart that the whisper was just a figment of her rotting imagination. When she didn’t hear it again for a while, she tried to tell herself that it wasn’t real, even though she strained to hear it. She had half convinced herself when she heard it again.
 <p class="text1"><font color="#000000">
“Little Peanut, where are you my Love?”
 <p class="text1"><font color="#000000">
She swallowed in terror and refused to answer. A Soft footstep sounded on the floor over the other side of the room.
 <p class="text1"><font color="#000000">
“Where are you my Lovely little Peanut? Why won’t you answer me?”
 <p class="text1"><font color="#000000">
The peanut sat very still and held her breath, hoping that what ever it was would go away if it couldn’t find her. The footstep was heard again, further into the room this time. The peanut found herself trying to make out a shape in the darkness of the boarded up Dining Room. The whisper came again.
 <p class="text1"><font color="#000000">
“Come out Little Peanut, I won’t hurt you. The big bad human has gone and we can be together.”
 <p class="text1"><font color="#000000">
The peanut started to shake with fear as the soft footsteps came ever closer.
“Ah! There you are my Love. Now we can be together forever.”
 <p class="text1"><font color="#000000">
The footsteps stopped and against the glow of the fungus the peanut could make out a vague triangular shape. It was very big and had hair growing out of the crown of it’s head. The moment seemed to last for hours as the shape bent over and reached out a hand…

After being together 2 1/2 years,<BR>

Jill asked a question that<BR>

stopped me dead in my tracks,<BR>

caused my knees to weaken<BR>

and my tongue to go numb:

 <P>

Does this look all right?

 <P>
My first reaction was to the danger of it,<BR>

and then to the overwhelming feeling<BR>

one surely felt when a Greek Goddess<BR>

decided to step down to this world<BR>

for a moment and become mortal.
<P>
 

Speechless, I took too long to answer.
