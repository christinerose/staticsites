            <p><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><font color="#000000">With over 500 new books printed every day, it is becoming increasingly difficult to reach one’s niche audience.  Even with the internet, most people are suffering from information overload and just shut out new content or unrecognizable names.  There is just too much information to process on top of dealing with bills, work, and family.

</font></span></p>
            <p><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><font color="#000000">
More and more people are turning to sites like YouTube to get a daily dose of humor, news, or information in little three to seven minute snippets.  It’s perfect for a coffee break at work, or just when one’s manager is on the neighboring row of cubicles.  A quick escape from Corporate America, YouTube is a breath of fresh air.

</font></span></p>
            <p><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><font color="#000000">Christine Rose, co-author of <em>Rowan of the Wood</em>, is helping to relieve the tedium of corporate boredom by producing a video blog (vlog) entitled Storytime 2.0.  Once a week she covers a chapter in <em>Rowan of the Wood</em> in a very silly, magical way on her vlog.  Throughout the rest of the week she rambles about whatever is on her mind from Columbus Day to costuming.  She has increased her subscription base by ten-fold just in the last two weeks.  Interested parties can view her vlogs and subscribe at <A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/kalitara">www.youtube.com/kalitara</A></font></span></p>

            <p class="text1"><font color="#000000">	"Here's what we do. Let's see now."   Dercy dismounted, then closed her eyes to better see something unseen.   She opened them. There was a 
twinkle there.   The irises of her lovely eyes glittered with green and gold.

            <p class="text1"><font color="#000000">	   "Agis Ange!" Dercy invoked her aspect.    There was a shimmer around 
her. Quite suddenly, with a visual 'pop', the image sharpened into that 
of a tall, noble Sarahan female.   Dercy was now dressed in a shimmering 
gown.   The dress flowed and swirled in slow motion, moved by unfelt 
currents.   It was as if she stood underwater.   She wore satin 
slippers, pearl white upon her small feet.   Her figure was perfect, 
graced with a wasp-waist and long, languid arms.   Each casual movement 
of her soft hand and slender fingers seemed a supple pose. About her 
head was a gleaming band of white gold.   From her ears hung artfully 
enameled earrings beneath which swung teardrop pearls. Her brown hair 
was long, thick and lustrous.   Her hair's crown was woven into an 
impossible complex pattern that allowed curls and ringlets to dance 
about her face.   Subtle weaves structured the hair into a noble 
climax.   Her bearing was confident.   Her skin was luminous.   Her face 
glowed with goodness.   Her soft, knowing smile gave clear evidence of a 
wealth of soul.   Her face was the perfect proportion of wisdom and grace.
She had wings! She had wings upon her back that filled the eye with a 
light that could illuminate beyond the shine of A brilliant day!   The 
sky about her begged to lift her up!   Her glorious wings reached beyond 
her to either side, gossamer thin and sparkling with whips and twinkles 
of diamond-light.   Dream-perfect, they seemed poised, ready to lift her 
to the golden throne of a god.   It was easy to imagine that some 
awesome but lonely power stood atop the world's highest mountain, 
waiting for her and her alone. 

            <p class="text1"><font color="#000000">  She seemed perfect, warm and wonderful but so far beyond the reach of mortals.    She was liquid beauty.   She was radiant, the most divine 
sight that the poor eyes of Man had ever seen. 

            <p class="text1"><font color="#000000">	"How do you like it?" she said.

 <p class="text1"><font color="#000000">The village folk lit the fire beneath her, and the crowd cheered.  She looked down at the faces filled with hatred and disgust, and her own anger blazed brighter.  She was being burned for witchcraft.  She had used her powers only for good throughout the past nine centuries.  Thousands of people had been saved by her powers of healing.  She received no thanks for all her sacrifice, for all her help, for all her kindness.  She looked down at these people, and for the first time, truly looked down on them.  Sheep!  They were sheep.  She was so much better than they were.  She had greater intelligence and a noble purpose.  She lived her life to rescue her love, the man other Christians had taken away from her long ago.  The Christians had ruined her wedding day, killing her friends and robbing her of her beloved, they who had doomed her to an eternity of chastity and desolation.  Christians, just like these now before her, had been the cause of all her woes.  Today would be the day of her revenge.  She would repay their ruthlessness in kind, showing them the same consideration they had shown her all these years.
