SIZE=-1>I met Ethan <A HREF="dance.html">Swing Dancing
</A>.  Little did we know we were meant to be together while we
were dancing casually with each other.  One day, he asked me out on a date; and I accepted.
He showed up
with a dozen long-stem red roses (shown bottom left).  Until then, I didn't know
he had a romance in mind, because I didn't!  However, after that first date and
quite-an-incredible-phone conversation or two later, I was already falling
for him.  He was everything!  Conscious, compassionate, vegetarian, pagan, handsome, sexy,
a great dancer, honest, kind, understanding, generous, supportive, ... etc ... etc ... etc.  
I could go on and on!</TD></TR>

SIZE=-1>Since then we have been so very much in love!!  We have also had
many adventures together already.  We went on a hot air balloon ride (pictured top)
, we go <A HREF="scuba.html">SCUBA</A> diving together, and we take karate
together, too!  We still, of course go <A HREF="dance.html">Swing Dancing</A>, but now
we go Ballroom Dancing as well!  We will be going to England together this November.  Check
my <A HREF="art.html">Travel</A> page for details and pictures.  :-)</TD></TR>

SIZE=-1>We were handfasted this past <A HREF="spirit.html#pagan">Lughnasadh</A> in an ancient
Scottish Tradition of a year and a day.  He gave me a beautiful rose pin as 
a favor and a symbol of his name... until the time comes that I take it both
spiritually and legally. :-) !!  He is my soul and my song.  He is my
angel, my all, my other self.  He is my true love. For all time.</TD></TR>
