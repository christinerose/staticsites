<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>     </span>My exploration into historical Christianity
began during my post-graduate years in Texas while in my mid-twenties.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I had been raised Catholic, and I really
didn’t know anything other than Christianity, with it’s various faiths, existed
in the way of religion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In Graduate
School, I met an assortment of strong, intelligent individuals that helped me
broaden my horizons, as it were, and begin to see the historical evidence
behind the dogma.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I also read some
obscure early Native American travel journals in an American Literature class
about monks and conversions in the pre-dawn of America.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Sunday school did not teach this kind of
material.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I learned of betrayals and
power struggles within the church.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I
learned about the inquisition and how the Medieval church converted the
“heathens” of early Britain through threats and torture and death.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I learned how Christian holidays actually
were invented to cover up ancient Pagan holidays to assist these said
“conversions.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I also learned how monks
in early America raped young Native American girls and their mothers while they
sent the men away on errands.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I was
utterly horrified!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I felt that I had
been lied to my entire life.<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>    </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>     </span>Thus began my search into other
religions:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Buddhism, Paganism,
Hinduism, Shamanism, etc.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I became
utterly fascinated by all religions and spiritual paths, desperately searching
for the truth I felt was hidden somewhere within it all.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>For I knew in my core that they were all the
same at the most basic level, and it was the practice of said religions that
caused the, sometimes fatal, differences between them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>     </span>Now, almost a decade later, I have come
full circle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I now see the similarities
between Buddhism and Christ’s teachings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>I see the connections between Pagan and Christian traditions.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It occurred to me that it need not be one
religion or another; that they indeed were all the same.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Recently, I have come across ancient
Christian documents discovered in this century that have opened my eyes further
into the essence of True Christianity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Back to my roots, as it were.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I
find that it’s not so much that Christianity didn’t fit me, but what I had been
taught – what every Christian is taught – is very likely not what Jesus had
taught.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Through all my years of
searching, my love and respect for Jesus, the man, has remained constant.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In these new findings, I see why.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>Let me start by saying that I do not intend
this work to befall scholarly scrutiny.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>I fully realized many of the notions put forth here do not have the
extensive historical and literary documentation of sources as a scholarly work
would demand.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This book is meant to get
the ideas and philosophies of obscure, albeit valid, information into the hands
of the public.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I have cited the more
scholarly sound works for further examination at the leisure of my
readers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>However, to quote Vaclavik, I,
too, have “little respect for Christian tradition as being historically
accurate;” so, in addition to perusing canonical and Christian works, I have
cited non-canonical and non-Christian sources as well.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>Many ostensibly ambiguous theories are put
forth in this work:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Jesus lived in
India and studied Buddhism; Jesus and early Christians were vegetarians; and
Jesus was married and had a child with Mary Magdalen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>Since I have studied Buddhism myself, I can
see the connections between the teachings of Jesus and the basic precepts of
Buddhism.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>     </span>Since I am an ethical vegetarian myself, I
became intrigued with the possibility of Jesus (Yeshua) and the early
Christians also striving toward a compassionate diet.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>It certainly made sense to me as it fits perfectly with Jesus’
message of peace and compassion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>     </span>Since I, too, am married and in love, I can
understand the connection between Jesus and Mary.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>     </span>I write this as I approach the age of Yeshua at his
crucifixion.It humbles me to think of
what he accomplished and how he directly and indirectly changed the world and
the future in his short thirty-something years on earth.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I extend gratitude to my readers for taking
the time to explore this most interesting subject with me.</p>

research therein began not only as an attempt to commingle and solidify the

the right track.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That felt good.<span

they think “Holy Book,” “Good Book” or “Word of God.”<span style="mso-spacerun:

the word and the book originated.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The
word “bible” comes from the Greek term “Ta Biblia,” plural; “To Biblion,”
singular.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It refers to the inner bark
of the papyrus plant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Made from the

scrolls.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Several scrolls kept in

</span>The number of actual scrolls in this “Bible” would vary depending on the
wealth of the owners.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>These scrolls
contained the Torah, first five books of law in the Old Testament, as well as

keep in mind that the concept of a “Bible” was in fact very different than the
concept these days.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In fact, the

until about 100 C.E. – the early <u>Christian</u> period, about 70 years after
the crucifixion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>These books were
written in Hebrew, but since Hebrew was a dead language by the time Yeshua was

work and, miraculously, as it was told, all came up with the exact same
translation!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This translation was
referred to as Septuagint, Latin for “seventy,” often abbreviated as LXX (70 in
Roman Numerals), named after these translators.<span style="mso-spacerun:

of the original mis-translations occurred from these translations.<span

“parthenos,” whereas the word translated from Hebrew meant “young woman.”<span

conceive,” to “A <u>virgin</u> shall conceive.” (Matt. 1:23) Big
