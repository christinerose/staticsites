<font size="1">Note: All below information is either from our Aunt's, Eileen's, Ethan's or Scott's memory. If you have any information that is even close to this -  ... please let us know! I will try to get a more recent photo of Rowan (15 yrs ago).</font>
<UL>
<LI>Born <B>Rowan MaCuiogae</B> (pronounced Ma-Kway-O-Gee) August 12, 1966 in Berkeley, CA (Alameda County) in a house on Regent Street. <BR>Mother's maiden name:  <B>Frances Johnson (aka Rebecca Johnson, Rebecca Potimkin, or Kropotkin)</B>
<LI>
Father's name <B><A HREF="scott.html">Scott McKay MaCuiogae</A></B>, born in LA. 10-18-41
<LI>
Scott was active in the Peace movement in the San Francisco/Berkeley area during the late sixties. He met Frances/Rebecca at the San Jose Peace Center.
<LI>
Scott & Rebecca had another son, Ethan Orlando MaCuiogae (birth name), in Portland, OR - July 9, 1968. 
My guess is that they were living in <B>The Dalles, OR</B> at this time in a house with some people called the <B>Aptheckers.</B> Scott was 27 and Rebecca was 21.
<LI>
They also had a daughter, Eileen Sumi MaCuiogae May 19, 1970.
<LI>
About 1971, Frances/Rebecca and Scott split. For a short time, they each had the three children in turn. Scott last saw them around 1973 when he was living in Petaluma. Frances/Rebecca came to pick them up and take them to her parents. She never returned. She changed the surnames of her three children and herself to Rose (i.e. <B>Rowan Rose</B>, Ethan Rose, Eileen Rose and <B>Rebecca Rose</B>). She had an great interest with the Jewish faith and was possibly part Jewish.
<LI>Rebecca separated herself from her family as well - no one knew where she went. Ethan remembers living with the White Panther in a safe-house in Marin County. They were subjected to Police Raids and such. Very traumatic.
<li>
In about 1975/6 Ethan and Eileen got caught in a fire while living with the <B>White Panthers</B>. The state took custody of them, leaving Rowan with his mother.
<LI>
Ethan and Eileen grew up with Starcross, a monastic community in Northern, CA. They never saw their mother again after 1976/77. We have just found their father, whom they hadn't seen since '73.
<LI>
Rebecca and Rowan completely disappeared. 
<LI>c. 1976, Rebecca abandoned Rowan (10 yrs old) in Mexico. He peddled on the streets for a few weeks before she came back to get him.
<LI>c. 1979, Rebecca stabbed him 13 times with a knife (or scissors?). She dumped him in a ditch off the San Diego Freeway.
<LI>He likely never went to school and could barely read or write.
<LI> 
Around 1986, Rowan showed up at his maternal grandparent's home in Cupertino. Very angry and very violent. He has been discribed as a skin head. It was around this time he changed his name legally to Oliver Gray. He had a lot of anger for his mother, who apparently was insane and likely an on-and-off prostitute. The last Ethan knows was he went on a rampage and broke all the windows in their grandfather's truck with a baseball bat... then disappeared. Rowan/Oliver didn't get along with his grandfather, Lamar, but thought his grandmother was a "neat old gal." He supposedly had a problem with alcohol at this time (as did his grandfather) - which might have caused some of the anger between them.
<LI>
The only contact after that was a strange phone call to their Aunt Patricia c. 1996/7. She said he wouldn't tell her where he was, but she got the feeling it was his "one phone call" from either and institution or a jail. She also says she had the impressin he went north (i.e. Oregon, Washington or Canada).
<LI>
Eileen remembers him as being a Great Cartoonist. She said he had some contacts to whom he sold some of his pictures. He wanted to draw cars for companies (future models).
</UL>
<P><B>ANY INFORMATION - no matter how insignificant it may seem - would be GREATLY helpful. Positive or Negative - even speculative. Any memory or piece of memory would help. "He was mean" or "He was great!" or whatever - ANYTHING! An "I saw him with so-and-so" would even be helpful. (you get the picture :-)
<P>If ANY of these names ring a bell, esp. the ones in bold,... <U>please</U> let us know.</B> <A HREF="MAILTO:kalitara22@hotmail.com"> EMAIL US! </A>
<P>We do not by any means wish to intrude upon Oliver/Rowan's life. If he doesn't wish to be reunited with his family, we will accept that without judgment or pain. We would like to know when we find him, regardless, so that we may stop our search. It is quite time consuming and expensive! :-)
