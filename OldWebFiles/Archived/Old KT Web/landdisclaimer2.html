<P>
Land is part of an association with dues. Something like $10/year. You won't even know the association exists until the bill comes every year, but they do some good things behind the scenes like road maintenence and ensuring the community well is safe for drinking. Property taxes are only around $230/yr.
<P>
The community well is 3 miles away, and it's $100/yr for a key. Most residents up there keep a water tank on the back of a truck to get water.  The cabin/property is plumbed, but there is no large water tank there for holding.  There are 2 or 3 fifty gallon barrels that we used.
<P>
You <b>can</B> drill your own well.
<P>
<I>There is no current power to the cabin</I>.  The cabin itself is wired, and it can be run on a generator or through solar/wind power.  It's how we did it when we were up there.
<P>
The "bath house" is just a storage shed now.  It's about 8 x 16.
<P>
The winters are very harsh and <I>very</I> beautiful. It's a winter wonderland... seriously. But it's also harsh.  You should have a way to get to the road in the winter as the roads are not plowed unless you (or other residents) do it yourself.  There is a resident who normally plows the first mile down Kodiak from the road... so you will be responsible for the last 1/2 mile.  You can pay him or another resident to do it... or you can have a truck with a snow blade to do it yourself.  The property comes with a snow blower for your use.  That's how we kept the roads open.  It works, but it's a lot of work. Some residents use a snowmobile to get to and from a vehicle they keep near the highway.
<P>
<B>This is wilderness. Pure and beautiful and full of life.
<P>
It's perfect for a snowmobile getaway with rustic accomodations</B>
<P>
The county is aware that the cabin exists and is without permits. <B>They <U>haven't done anything</U> in two and a half years but send two letters</B> to the realtor, not even to me. Once the property is sold, they can't do a thing as it becomes "pre-existing" for the new owner.  You can even claim we told you nothing about it.  If you talk with them now, they will try to scare you away.  They're bureaucrats who want their $$. 
<P>
<!--The 5 month mandatory lease is for your protection and ours. You can see if you can deal with the winters, and we can see if you will pay on time before registering the deal with the county.--> Payments will be set up to be deposited directly from your account into ours as an automatic payment.  No checks, no hassle.
<P>
<I>This property is not for the faint-of-heart.</I> Best for those who like to 'stick it to the man' and do what they want... the perfect tenant/owner for this property knows the meaning of the word <B>freedom</B>.
<P>
If you are interested in this land and understand all the above, please don't hesitate to call me. We want it sold ASAP.  We're highly motivated sellers.  Make an offer.  Christine 512.923.0475
<P>DIRECTIONS: 30 miles East from Klamath Falls on HWY 140.  Between mile marker 31 and 32, left on Kodiak Road (dirt).  1.5 miles down on the right.
