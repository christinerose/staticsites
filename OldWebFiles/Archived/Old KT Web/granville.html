<B>Bed & Breakfast potential in Granville Ferry, <A HREF="http://www.novascotia.com/" TARGET="TOP">Nova Scotia</A>, Canada.</B> Granville Ferry is a small community directly across the Annapolis River from Annapolis Royal (another small community) on the Bay of Fundy side of Nova Scotia. Both the summers and winters are milder there. The temperatures range from (Fahrenheit) 5 - 40 degrees in the winter and 60 - 80 degrees in the summer. 
<P>
This year Annapolis Royal celebrated their 400th birthday. It is the earliest settlement in Nova Scotia (1605). 
<P>Known as "Granville House," it was a hotel over 100 years ago. We rescued it from complete ruin when we bought and renovated it last year. It hadn't been lived in for over 25 yrs, but we restored it to its original glory and then some! It even has a heater now to stay warm on those Nova Scotia nights.
<P>
<B>It has 14 rooms, 2.5 baths, refridgerator, stove/oven, W/D, and a Carriage House garage.</B>
<P>
Granville House can be fully operational for the plethora of tourists coming from Europe and the US next year. If you've ever dreamed of running a Bed & Breakfast in paradise, here is your chance! 
<P>
<B>It is located right in between the General Store and the Sweetwater Bakery - prime location! Friendly neighbors!</B>
