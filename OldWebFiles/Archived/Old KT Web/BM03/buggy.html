<TD>Although it still had issues this year (with the tires, mostly) -- it did help us move across Hushville out of a sticky situation! Thanks to Ethan's amazing design, the Sun Bug-E moved the fountain as well as the rest of Nirvana across Hushville! It also helped us haul things to the community burn platform at the end.
<P>
Next year, we plan to get solid rubber tires and stronger wheels -- we'll have it down next year. Third time's a charm!</TD>
