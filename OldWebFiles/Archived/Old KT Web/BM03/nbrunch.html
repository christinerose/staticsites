<TD><B>Each morning between 8-10AM, Ethan served Organic, Vegan Pancakes (Playacakes) They've been very popular the last THREE years, and we've made A LOT of great friends & received some cool gifts because of them. Look for a new sign next year -- since this one ended up in the community burn pile!<P> Believe it or not, this year we were hassled by the Nevada Health Department! Seems you can't serve food to your "friends" on the playa -- only "campmates" without a health permit. Drugs and alcohol are OKAY -- just not pancakes!
<P>Strangely again -- we didn't get any pictures of the Naked Brunch. So, if anyone has any -- please send them to us!</TD></TR>
