<!--BEGIN TITLE & STORY-->
"Red Riding Hood: A Parody of Nathaniel Hawthorne's <I>Young Goodman Brown</I>" <BR>by E.S. Hudler - <A HREF="http://www.loftlore.com">www.loftlore.com</A>  (continued from the newsletter)
<P><BR />
     "The sun is all but gone, Red Riding Hood, and pray tell what is
in the basket?"<P><BR />  
     "Tis only food for my sainted Grandmother, who has been kind to me
all my life, and to whom I'm tasked to fetch a meal."<P><BR />  
     "No, say you! And doubtless only good things would you so convey,
for do you not worship her as an old friend?"<P><BR />  
     "Leave me your questions, you devilish cur, and I will not travel
with the likes of your evil self! Begone before I call my Cutter with
his gleaming ax!"<P><BR />  
     So he, knowing a thing, ran ahead to that place wherein
Grandmother lived, He knocked on the old, withered door and paused.
     "Who might it be?" spoke a voice faint and frail.<P><BR />  
     "Only me, Red Riding Hood," he cried out in a mournful yet high
voice. "I have toiled through the wicked forest to bring you a pleasant
repast. Pray let me in so that I may with a clear conscience see you
well fed."<P><BR />  
     Though curious at Red Ridings Hood's strange tone, Grandmother
slowly opened the door, unknowing that a beastly shadow crouched
without.<P><BR />  
     In the fiend leapt, all in a rage, laughing more frightfully than
would a howling demon! "Now you are lost, pious Grandmother, and I
shall eat you down to your very bones! Ha!"<P><BR />  
     Grandmother set forth shouting, a frightful, desperate noise, but
soon the room echoed with the hideous sounds of demoniac feeding.<P><BR />  
     And now the forest at night gave forth Red Riding Hood at the door
of the now truly sainted Grandmother. Her soft, loving knocking mingled
poorly with the dreadful sounds of the denizens of the night.<P><BR />  
     The abomination within, now bound in the garb of the heaven sent
Grandmother, leapt into the bosom of the bed. "Come in, my child," said
he, an evil apparition in the guise of a righteous woman.<P><BR />  
     Was this her loved Grandmother, this misshapen hag she strained to
behold? "If thou be my virtuous Grandmother, why doest thou have such
big ears?"<P><BR />  
     "Tis for the better to hear you with, my child," lied the
deceiving, miserable figure.<P><BR />  
     "Can this be so?" said Red Riding Hood with doubtful expression.
"And howbeit that thine eyes seem so big?"<P><BR />  
     "Tis for the better to see you with, my child," canted the
hypocritical serpent.<P><BR />  
     "So sayest you!" returned the now frightened Red Riding Hood. With
fear frozen steps, she moved forward and whispered with quivering
voice, "And howbeit that thou have such big teeth?"<P><BR />  
     "Tis for the better to eat you with!" vented the evil beast,
bursting forth from the bed in a hail of froth and yellowed fangs!
     Red Riding cried in deepest despair, "Cutter, my husband with the
gleaming ax, save my virtuous life!"<P><BR />  
     At that moment Cutter did appear, and there he stood in the door
and shouted, "Down boy! Bad dog! Didest I not tell thee to but guard my
holy wife, and to keep her safe?"<P><BR />  
     "Dearest Red Riding Hood," offered the woodsman, gazing at his
goodwife while holding his gleaming ax, "Doest thou not like my new
pet?"<P><BR />  
     Alas she did not, and her days thereafter became misery, Often at
night she did shrink away from her husband, Cutter, and from his
gleaming ax. Her song of life became an anthem of misery and she died
in bitter gloom.
