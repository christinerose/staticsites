<!--BEGIN TITLE & STORY-->
"The Sight Sword" by E. S. Hudler  (continued from the newsletter)
<P><BR />
           She felt it first, then imagined that she saw it. A formless,  amorphous, shape appeared in her bright world. A hole opened up. She blinked to better see the formless black in the brightness. It defied her awareness, and refused to reveal what it was. It floated in her dream. It came down until it was very close. It hung over Dercy, just out of reach. Everand had come.

<P><BR />
"I see you, abomination!" Everand had spoken to Dercy's mind.

<P><BR />
Dercy opened her eyes. She took the nearby Sight sword in her hands and stood. She had walked in dreams of inky darkness. Now she became the source and center of a snowy-white light. Though she couldn't see through her own light, she knew the orphan star was overhead, and through it, Everand pressed down upon her. Hearing his voice in her mind 
was more than Dercy could bear. She lifted the Sight sword and pointing it toward the orphan star. Effortlessly, she tapped her anger and her need to defend herself. She reached for help and unchecked her fury. The Sight sword was there for her, and its power was vast. She sent the weapon's might into the dark night's sky.

<P><BR />
Instantly, the soft glowing light she had created was replaced with the strobe flash of thunder and lightning. The illumination she invoked wasn't just the perfect white of a lightning strike. Her blast was a 
concussion of force gathered from the soul of the Sight sword. She loosed it without restraint, pushing it upward. The force smashed at the black of space with a blue-white brilliance. Power leap into the darkness faster and further than the eye could follow. The bolt she loosed snapped, jerked, divided and crossed itself many times. It moved upward like the tip of God's mighty whip. Power twisted and reached into the night. The light gave violent birth to a shock of sound. Nothing, not even Dercy's own full-throated scream, could be heard over the blast. She reached for more power, and found it easily. The sword was now the fountainhead of two vivid whips of power. Three, then moments later, six of the mighty blasts vaulted into the heavens. The roar of the energy released was such that the mission's others were on their knees covering their ears as tightly as they could. The horses, even those horses bred for combat by desert Invokers were frenetic in their attempts to escape the conflagration. Dercy was but thirty strides behind the animals. The soil around her began to raise a fog. Nearby trees leaned away from the force, bending up and away. Branches snapped from some of the trees. These caught fire as they passed near bolts of force. They were hurled ablaze into the brilliance and blackness of the sky. Some trees sent their entire crop of leaves into the night. The burning leaves glowed all around the mission. A rising curtain of sparks became a golden fountain of leaves on fire. Everywhere there were ten thousand dancing shadows. The flash of snapping bolts brought fresh brilliance to each and every corner of the forest. Dercy discharged her boundless anger and thundered it into the night. The passion of her wrath was made manifest as bolt after bolt of power erupted from the Sight sword. The air above her began to glow impossible shades of pink, green and yellow-red. The ground shook. Quakes and tremors were released from under Dercy's feet. They propagated vast distances as the land began to roll. The dynamic force she had unleashed, and continued to unleash, would, could and was tearing the world apart.
<P><BR />
Quite suddenly Dercy felt a hand on the back of her shoulder. She was not startled, nor was she surprised. The hand gave her strength, not the strength of force but the strength of knowing. It gave her will back to 
her, taking it away from an unthinking rage. Most of all the touch gave her love. Now she understood the damage her anger and hatred was doing. 
<P><BR />

She saw what she had wrought. She understood the danger to the world should she continue. With great effort, but not without help, Dercy began to sever her connection with infinite power. She extinguished the 
lightning and emerged from the force. She returned to the love she missed so much. She dropped the smoldering Sight sword onto the smoking, quivering ground.

<P><BR />
Dercy turned in the direction of the warm hand on her shoulder. There stood the glowing shape of her dead husband. He was iridescent. Diamond winks of spectral light passed through and around him. Balanor smiled at his wife.
<P><BR />
"I have never left you. I have been beside you every moment, awake or asleep. You need never worry about losing me. You are not alone. I shall abide with you until you come to abide with me. We shall abide with each other together forever.
<P><BR />

Dercy smiled. Her eyes swam. Her bottom lip quivered ever so slightly. 
<P><BR />

"I am yours, Balanor. I am not afraid. I understand now." Dercy paused. 

<P><BR />
"Someone has died. Your teacher Efferaet..."
<P><BR />

"He's here with me." Balanor's voice became distant and muted. "Free my people, Dercy." Balanor's shape diffused. It evaporated into a gossamer shadow. His iridescent outline dimmed to a glow, a translucent mist. 
<P><BR />

When the mist dissipated, golden diamond lights twinkled once, twice, and were gone.
<P><BR />
Dercy uttered no protest. She did not reach or call out. She simply stood there, lost in thought. She seemed perfectly composed.
<P><BR />

The orphan star orbited overhead, untouched.
