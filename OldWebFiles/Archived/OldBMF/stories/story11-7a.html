<!--BEGIN TITLE & STORY-->
"The Hanged Man" by Richard Ridyard  (continued from the newsletter)
<P><BR />
           "Teddy Boy," he'd say. "You're like a spare tart at a wedding; sitting there with your legs crossed guarding your honor."<P><BR />
Teddy! That's what my father used to call me. Teddy. My mum would say, "his name's Edward," but my dad would ignore her and go on calling me Teddy.<P><BR />
He knew I hated it, but he didn't care. Just like Happy doesn't care. When we're on stage in front of a thousand people he'll say: "Watch where you're putting your hand, Teddy Boy. How'd you like it if I stuck my fingers up your bum." And he'd wink with that heavy, false eye and the crowd would fall about laughing. <P><BR />Laughing with him and at me! Just like my father used to laugh at me ... and the kids at school too. I hated school. Hated those staring eyes. The boys making fun of me because I didn't join in their stupid games ... and the girls giggling because I didn't chat them up. <P><BR />
I remember one of the girls complaining to the teacher that I'd tried to grope her. It wasn't true ... but the teacher told my father and he thrashed me. That's why I hated school and hated my father. They had found the weaknesses in me and deliberately played on them. No pity! No affection! No love! I guess they enjoyed watching me cry. And now Happy enjoys making me cry, in front of everyone. At first the audience didn't know how to handle it ... weren't sure whether it was all part of the act. They were a little uneasy about seeing a grown man cry. <P><BR />
But Happy made a joke of it. Turned it into a pantomime. He'd deliberately start to slip off my knee, pretending he was being washed away by the tears. "For God's sake, stop bawling," he'd say, "or you'll get water on the knee and I'll get wet rot." <P><BR />
The audience loved it. And they loved him. He knew how to win them over and make me look a pitiful fool at the same time. The applause was for him. The crowd came to see him. So I guess it was only fair that he should get top billing ... 'Happy and his sad stooge'. <P><BR />
There was no stopping him. Theatre, radio, television. Everyone wanted him. He even made a Royal Command Performance Show and the Press got pictures of him shaking hands with royalty while my face was blanked out in the background. When the reporters wanted an interview it was Happy who answered their questions. When we appeared on a T.V. Chat Show it was Happy who was interviewed, not me. I kept quiet, said nothing ... just like a dummy!<P><BR />
"If it goes on like this," Happy said to me, " you'll soon be redundant. Better start looking for another career, Teddy Boy. I can always find another knee to sit on but, without me, you've got nothing. You're dead, man! Dead!" <P><BR />
And he'd give that cynical laugh. Just like my old man, when I fell over and cut my knee. I tried not to cry but he could see the tears starting in my eyes. The stinging of the iodine as he forced it into the wound, and the stinging of his eyes as they forced their way into my mind. <P><BR />
They were more than I could stand and my father knew he'd won once more. Then I'd run to my mother and hide my face in her skirt ... a skirt smelling of warm toast, baking bread, rice pudding. 
All the safe, loving smells that still remind me of a woman who devoted her whole life to me; a woman who died before I had a chance to repay her for all her sacrifices. After she died, things got worse with my father. He tried to make me feel guilty for her death but I knew it was really his fault, and I never forgave him. <P><BR />
"You ain't got your mum to run to now," he'd say. "Maybe now, we'll teach you to be a real man and not a mummy's boy."<P><BR />
But I knew what his 'real men' were like. Dirty, crude, beer-swilling friends who came rolling home with him on a Saturday night, usually with a couple of women in tow. <P><BR />
Sleeping in my mother's bed, using my mother's sheets and towels ... all the things she took pride in being abused, and adulterated, by that scum! When I told them to stop, they took no notice; just like Happy takes no notice when I beg him to leave me alone. And the audience takes no notice when I tell them to stop laughing at me. And my father took no notice when I tried to stop him hitting my mum. Somehow all those grinning faces blend into one set of features with dark, bushy eyebrows spread across a wooden brow and a black gash of a mouth open in a malicious grin. <P><BR />
It's a face I'll always recognise. The face of the man I killed!<P><BR />
The face that haunts me almost twenty years later; the face that stared up at me, cold yet victorious, with the knife still sticking in his chest. My lawyer advised me to plead guilty but with diminished responsibility. In other words pretend I didn't know what I was doing ... that I was mentally disturbed, crazy! So I did ... and the jury believed me! <P><BR />
For twelve years I stayed in their prison. Behaved myself, did what I was told, followed their rules. I had to prove I'd recovered my sanity and was no longer a threat to their society. While I was in jail, I met an old pro who'd been on the stage in his younger days. He taught me all he knew about ventriloquism. How to throw my voice; keep my face impassive; act the stooge to my own dummy. I entertained the other prisoners ... performed at the Christmas show. They even gave me permission to go round the hospitals, doing shows for the sick and the pensioners. That's how the media first noticed me. <P><BR />
A reporter for a national newspaper came to one of the shows and thought it would make a good Christmas story. 'Convict spreads good cheer at Christmas' ... that was the headline. And then the television boys took it up and asked me to appear on an amateur talent show. I was scared, terrified of making a fool of myself in front of millions of people. Frightened of being booed for what I'd done in the past. Strange how the public can either take to you or not. I was a bit of a freak. They switched on to see the murderer but stayed to enjoy the entertainer. <P><BR />
My fame spread like wildfire. They released me from prison early and I got a spot on a radio show, which led to a weekly appearance on television. For the first time in my life I felt I'd achieved something. I'd done it all myself and there was no one there to ridicule me or make me feel insecure. Never again would I have to face contempt from my father or anyone else. But I was wrong. I know that now, and so does Happy. He's been biding his time, fooling me into believing I was in charge of my own destiny ... that I could control both him and me. It can't be, I realise it now. <P><BR />
As long as I live he'll haunt me, taunt me, then destroy me. There's only one escape for me ... for both of us. Tomorrow they'll find us hanging from a beam in the centre of this room ... two stiff, inanimate puppets on the ends of our strings, our faces blackened and contorted by the tightened rope. Happy and his stooge. the master and his puppet. Perhaps then they'll know ... will understand ... will look closely at the two bodies hanging side by side, and will see the inescapable resemblance ... the face of the dummy and the face of the hanged man!
