Removed Dalton from all web pages. Sent notice for termination of contract today. As you can imagine, Deltina never did was was stated below.

Changed the Rowan website and linked directly to SMN. Deltina will be making a new one at some point, but for now -- this is it. After she makes it, it will be linked to hers. I'm keeping the "media.html" file as-is for now in case we need it later.

Changed the top links from "the story" "the characters" "the authors" to:

"about" "reviews" "newsroom" and "fun stuff"

Author information will be brief on "about the book" (as well as short synopsis) with a link to www.christineandethan.com 

The old pages authors.html, characters.html, and media.html are in the folder "Old Pages"
