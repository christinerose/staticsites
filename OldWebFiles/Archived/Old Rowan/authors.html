				<p>Christine is an entrepreneur at heart.  Often described as a "free spirit" she is believed to have gypsy blood running through her veins, which explains why she moves around so much. (Although some claim that she has ants in her pants.)
<P>
Christine produced two documentary films and has credits on IMDB.com.  The first film enjoyed a theatrical premiere in Paris and a considerable amount of international press.  She also planned and executed a 40-US city promotional tour for it.  She has had articles appear in several magazines, including <I>MovieMaker Magazine</I> and <I>IndieSlate Magazine</I> discussing her career as an independent filmmaker. 
<p>
She holds her M.A. in English and wrote her Master’s Thesis on Malory's <I>Le Morte D’arthur</I>.  Her favorite authors include Shakespeare, Swift and Vonnegut, with a more recent adoration of J.K. Rowling and Neil Gaiman.</p>

<p>Although many tragic heroes begin as orphans, Ethan actually was one.  He grew up amongst the magical redwoods in Northern California and read anything he could get his hands on.... still does. He has read virtually every fantasy novel ever written.  His favorite authors include JRR Tolkien, Terry Pratchett and Ursula LeGuin. 
<p>
He enjoys dragging his wife out on a 10-day pilgrimmage to Black Rock City every August to serve pancakes on the playa. 
<p>
Christine and Ethan met swing dancing in 1999 and were married a year later.  They've traveled together extensively across the USA, in the U.K., Canada and France.  Christine’s scholarly, goal-oriented background mixed with Ethan’s knowledge of fantasy creates an impenetrable team of writers who look forward to writing more books together and to promoting this book across the country and the world.  
<p>
This novel is the first in a series.  They have already started to adapt it for a Graphic Novel, working with the incredibly talented Ia Layadi of Wink! Design.  She designed the book cover and the image of Rowan in the header is her depiction of him for the Graphic Novel.
