<P>
"<B><I>Rowan of the Wood</B></I> is a fanciful and intriguing book about love, loss, magic and a centuries old quest. With a likeable group of heroes, and a set of villains that you can actually feel sorry for at points, they take you on a mystical tale that spans fourteen centuries and leads to the twenty-first century where a misfit boy has to take on an enormous responsibility."

<P>
<blockquote>
<P>a fantastic and believable read.  The love that doesnt really die between Rowan and Fiana is powerful.  The loneliness of Cullen and his love of doing what is right is wondrous.  I loved this book and anyone who loves fantasy will love it, too. The authors have gotten this one right and I highly recommend it.<B>- Marta Morrison, <a href="http://www.teensreadtoo.com/RowanOfTheWood.html" target="_blank">Teens Read Too</A> (5 stars + Gold Star Award for Excellence)</B>

<blockquote>
<P>"The mythology in the book was outstanding. It combined a little bit of vampire with a lot of Celtic, and I thought it was an excellent combination...Its even possible that I enjoyed the chapters in historical settings better than the chapters in the current time, although they gradually got darker. I would be very interested to read more in this series, as well as more by these authors, if they can work up a novel like this their first time out." <b><a href="http://www.readalready.com/2008/12/11/rowan-of-the-wood-by-christine-and-ethan-rose/" target="_blank">Someone's Read It Already</A></b>

<blockquote>
<P>"This book was so fun and different. I’ve never read a book like this before, the characters are very original, I LOVE Marlin. The book changes between a bunch of different characters points of view, so you get to see what’s going on in all of their heads. And it goes between the different times in history, but everything seems to flow very nicely together." - Kayla of <a href="http://midnighttwilightsbookblog.blogspot.com/2009/01/rowan-of-wood-by-christine-and-ethan.html" target="_blank">Midnight Twilight</A></blockquote>

<P>"Magic, lost love, vampirism, history, and modern times - how do they all fit together? If you wanted to know, you would have to read Rowan of The Wood by Christine and Ethan Rose. Rowan of The Wood is a fantasy novel, but it is also more, and it is one eBook that you aren’t going to want to miss!" - <a href="http://www.ebookguru.org/index.php/2008/12/fiction-ebook-review-rowan-of-the-wood-by-christine-ethan-rose/" target="_blank">eBook Guru</A> (finalist for Dec08 eBook-of-the-month [Kindle Version])</blockquote>

<P>"I especially loved all the characters, and seeing their desires, fears, motivations, etc. The problems that time created also kept me entertained: Fiana's battle with her approaching death, and Rowan's confusion with the modern world that Cullen lives in." <B>- <A HREF="http://www.mrsmagooreads.com/2008/10/saturdays-scribe-christine-rose.html" target="_blank">Mrs. Magoo Reads</A></B>

"I thought it was terrific! I almost read it straight through but had to stop to get some much needed sleep. At the end I wanted to read more...Your books are sure to be family favorites.

"I just finished reading <B><I>Rowan of the Wood</I></B>.  My husband and I purchased your book at the Florence Renaissance Faire.  When I began reading I knew that I would not want the book to end.  What an adventure!  I am 62 years old and I enjoyed every word of it.  I cannot wait until the next book is written.
    Thanks for sharing your imagination with the world. Huzzah!! "

"<B><I>Rowan of the Wood</I></B> was an incredibly wonderful book to read. I just got it last weekend at Middlefaire and it is so amazing, the summary on the back doesn't do it justice. I sincerely wish you two all the happiness and success in the world. Though it has a nasty habit of torturing the reader, it certainly kept me turning the pages. This is BY FAR one of my most favorite books of all time...Thank you so much for writing it, it has been a true gift to read."<BR><B>- Elise Mesnard, artist</B>

<blockquote>				
<p>
the main thing is the story, I believe, and <B><I>Rowan</B></I> has a good one. Cullen bonds with Rowan, in some ways literally, as the strong, caring adult that he craves. That Cullen and Rowan must face, together, a truth that may be too painful to bear seems to me the lynchpin of the story. This melding of the worlds of the child and the adult strikes me as quite inventive and sets this book apart from its predecessors in the orphan hero canon.<br><B>- Brian Malone, fantasy critic.</B> Read his entire <A HREF="http://bmalone.blogspot.com/2007/10/online-literature.html">review</A></p>
