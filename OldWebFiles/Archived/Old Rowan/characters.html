				<p>Rowan Macuiogae was chosen by the goddess to serve his people as priest of the tribe.  This honor filled his soul completely until he met the girl who would be priestess... none other than his beloved friend Fiana.  Through the years of extensive training, they became closer and fell in love.  Rowan looked forward to the day when they would become priest and priestess... but when that day came, so did the invaders.  One moment of hesitation separated them and Rowan had to hide within his wand for protection.  After a short time in his mind he was set free, if you could call it that.  Now he lives inside the body of a young boy in an unfamiliar place and time.  His only wish is to find his lost love. </p>

<p>
Cullen Knight is just like many other kids in the 7th grade: small, shy and very smart.  He's not very popular, which is okay with him as he'd rather be reading than socializing anyway.  He does have a few friends, names Maddy and April.  They're like the three musketeers, if they were American and outcasts.  Cullen has endured more pain in his 12 short years than most adults bear. He lost his father and sister in a fire when he was six, and his mother subsequently went insane.  He now lives with his foster family, who aren't very nice to him.  He thinks the Samuels only keep him to see what his Trust held.</p>

			<div class="body">
				
<p>
Fiana's life started out similar to Rowan's.  She was honored to be chosen to serve her people and the goddess, and she was in love.  She had escaped into the Otherworld with the others and watched her beloved Rowan trapped on the other side of reality, forced to hide in his wand for protection.  She returned a year later and vowed to find him and release him from his prison.  But years came and went, then decades... then centuries.  She never could find him, and she had to delve into darker magics to remain alive and well and continue her search.  Finally, once day centuries later, she had become something altogether different and all but forgot about her search... yet, they are destined to meet again.</p>

Madeline Wells and April Burton have been friends for as long as they can remember. Maddy likes life on the darker side, while April lives life in complete darkness.  She lost her sight because of an accident when she was just a baby.  Yet they along with Cullen make a great team.  They look out for each other and try to stay out of the popular kids' way. Now Cullen is going through some strange changes and he won't tell them what's happening.  Soon, they'll be going through some magical changes of their own.</p>

<p>
Max MacFey teaches 7th Grade English, and she loves it.  She never could understand why other teachers said that Jr. High was the worst grade to teach.  She couldn't be happier.  She has taken a special interest in one particular student.  Cullen has it rough at home, so she looks out for him from an appropriate distance.  However their lives will become undeniably intertwined due to an ancient prophecy handed down to her from her father.  She had always thought it just a story, but it is real.</p>
