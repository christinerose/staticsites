Hello world! :D 

I'm really liking Jekyll so much more than Gatsby! Whereas Gatsby took me hours and considerable frustration to set up, I was running Jekyll and editing this first site within 15 minutes!

Since I'm avoiding my take-home writing assignment for a possible new job because it's very difficult and makes my head hurt, I thought it was a perfect time to mess with Jekyll, as I'll be using this to edit our Ravencourt Cottage site with my partner Brian Enigma (thus Enigmatic Rose). 

This is also a great way to practice Markdown, as I haven't worked in .md for 5 years, and I need a refresher!
