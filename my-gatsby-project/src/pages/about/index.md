### International Petsitter Extraordiniare
Christine Marie Rose is a tech nomad, animal lover, and tap dancer. Between October 2015 and January 2018, she traveled the world petsitting in the UK, EU, and USA, while working remotely. She loves to go horseback riding in the English Lake District, snowshoeing in The Alps, hiking in the Scottish Highlands, and sea kayaking in the Hebrides. She now lives in Portland, Oregon with her partner, Brian, and their four cats. Still, she travels to Europe every year.

### Award-Winning Author
Christine is also the award-winning author of the 5-book *[Rowan of the Wood](https://amzn.to/3cwdu1n)* fantasy series, which she co-wrote (2008 – 2014) with her [ex-husband Ethan](http://ethanorose.wordpress.com/). Her 2010 Amazon.com bestselling book *[Publishing and Marketing Realities for the Emerging Author](https://christinerose.wordpress.com/publishing-marketing-realities/)* helped writers feel successful by educating them about the publishing industry and marketing their book during a tumultuous time in publishing. Since then, she’s been dabbling in memoir and toying with the idea of writing a play.

### Accomplished Artist
Christine is an accomplished fine artist with some work available on [Fine Art America](http://fineartamerica.com/profiles/4-christine-rose.html). She’s mostly worked in acrylics, but she’s been increasing her skills with [watercolor](https://christinerose.wordpress.com/2016/05/26/watercolor-my-world/) over the past few years. She takes beautiful photos of her travels, which you can see through her [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/professor.rose/) feed.

### Gimme Gimme Chocolate
She needs copious amounts of dark chocolate, frothy mochas, and silent solitude.
